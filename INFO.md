# MOBILE FIRST RESPONSIVE DESIGN INFO

#### What is Mobile-First Design?
Mobile-first design or Mobile-first approach enables web designers to
 start product design for mobile devices first. This can be done by sketching
 or prototyping the web app’s design for the smallest screen first and gradually 
working up to larger screen sizes.

## Mobile first
as the name suggests, means that we start the product design
 from the mobile end which has more restrictions,
 then expand its features to create a tablet or desktop version.


### Responsive web design 
is a web design method that enables web to fit the screens of
 different devices automatically, displaying the content in a way that people feel comfortable.
 This greatly reduces users’ operations like panning, zooming and scrolling when browsing the web


#### Progressive Advancement 
means that when we design a product, first we build a 
version for the relatively lower browser (like that on a mobile phone). This version 
includes the most basic functions & features. After that, we tend to the advanced 
version for a tablet or PC, which is created by adding interactions,
 more complicated effects, etc. on the basic version for a better user experience.


#### Graceful Degradation
    on the contrary, starts the product design from
 an advanced end like desktop and builds a version with well-rounded 
features at the beginning. Then designers make the product
 compatible with mobile ends by cutting some functions or contents.


### ADVANTAGES
1. Better User Experience on Mobile: Given the increasing use of smartphones, 
a mobile-first design ensures that users on these devices have a smooth and optimized experience. 
This can lead to increased engagement and satisfaction.

2. Faster Page Load Times: Prioritizing performance for mobile devices can result in 
faster page load times across all devices.Faster loading pages can reduce
 bounce rates and improve search engine rankings.

3. Responsive and Adaptive Design: Mobile-first design often leads to responsive and
 adaptive design, ensuring that your website or app looks and functions well on a wide range of devices.

4. Improved SEO: Search engines like Google prioritize mobile-friendly websites in their search results.
 A mobile-first approach can boost your website's search engine ranking.

5. Cost-Efficiency: By designing for mobile first, you're less likely to spend time and 
resources on features that may not be necessary. This can result in cost savings in the long run.



### DISADVANTAGES 
1. Additional Development Time: Designing for mobile-first can require more planning and 
development time, especially if you're dealing with complex features or layouts.
 It may also necessitate testing on multiple devices.

2. Limited Screen Space: Small screens on mobile devices can be limiting for displaying 
complex content or large datasets. Designing for mobile-first may require creative 
solutions to present this information effectively.

3. Content Simplification: While content prioritization is an advantage, it may also mean
 simplifying or cutting content that is available on the desktop version. 
This can be a disadvantage if certain information is crucial.

4. Potential for Missed Desktop Features: If not done carefully, a mobile-first approach
 can lead to overlooking or neglecting certain features that are more relevant on desktop devices

5. Testing Complexity: Testing across various devices and screen sizes to ensure 
a consistent user experience can be more complex with a mobile-first approach.
